================

1.0.7
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-28 16:00 P.M CEST

* on_decode_error is now called for exceptions in message_to_python
  (Issue #24).

* Redis did not respect QoS settings.

* BrokerConnection now supports a ``transport_options`` argument.

    This can be used to pass additional arguments to transports.

1.0.6
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-22 16:00 P.M CET

* The ``delivery_mode`` aliases (persistent/transient) were not automatically
  converted to integer, and would cause a crash if using the amqplib
  transport.

* Redis: The redis-py :exc:`InvalidData` exception suddenly changed name to
  :exc:`DataError`.

* The :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` environment variable can now be set to log all
  channel method calls.

  Support for the following environment variables have been added:

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_CHANNEL` will wrap channels in an object that
      logs every method call.

    * :envvar:`KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG` both enables channel logging and configures the
      root logger to emit messages to standard error.

    **Example Usage**::

        $ KOMBU_LOG_DEBUG=1 python
        >>> from kombu import BrokerConnection
        >>> conn = BrokerConnection()
        >>> channel = conn.channel()
        Start from server, version: 8.0, properties:
            {u'product': 'RabbitMQ',..............  }
        Open OK! known_hosts []
        using channel_id: 1
        Channel open
        >>> channel.queue_declare("myq", passive=True)
        [Kombu channel:1] queue_declare('myq', passive=True)
        (u'myq', 0, 1)

1.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2011-03-17 16:00 P.M CET

* Fixed memory leak when creating virtual channels.  All virtual transports
  affected (redis, mongodb, memory, django, sqlalchemy, couchdb, beanstalk).

* Virtual Transports: Fixed potential race condition when acking messages.

    If you have been affected by this, the error would show itself as an
    exception raised by the OrderedDict implementation. (``object no longer
    exists``).

* MongoDB transport requires the ``findandmodify`` command only available in
  MongoDB 1.3+, so now raises an exception if connected to an incompatible
  server version.

* Virtual Transports: ``basic.cancel`` should not try to remove unknown
  consumer tag.

1.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-28 16:00 P.M CET

* Added Transport.polling_interval

    Used by django-kombu to increase the time to sleep between SELECTs when
    there are no messages in the queue.

    Users of django-kombu should upgrade to django-kombu v0.9.2.

1.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-12 16:00 P.M CET

* ConnectionPool: Re-connect if amqplib connection closed

* Adds ``Queue.as_dict`` + ``Exchange.as_dict``.

* Copyright headers updated to include 2011.

1.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-01-31 10:45 P.M CET

* amqplib: Message properties were not set properly.
* Ghettoq backend names are now automatically translated to the new names.

1.0.1
=====
:release-date: 2011-01-28 12:00 P.M CET

* Redis: Now works with Linux (epoll)
